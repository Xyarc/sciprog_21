This practical contains two programs to preform matrix multiplication. 

1. MatrixMult.c - This program preforms matrix multiplication contained within one file

2. MatrixMult_main.c - This preforms the same calculation however in this case we have our matrix multiplication function in a seperate file. The program is then compiled using a makefile.

To compile and run the MatrixMult.c do the following:

1) Download MatrixMult.c

2) Compile MatrixMult.c with 'gcc -o <Executable name> MatrixMult.c -lm' in the file location

3) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location

To compile and run MatrixMult_main.c do the following:

1) Download  Makefile MatrixMult_func.c MatrixMult_main.c and add all files to same directory

2) In terminal type 'Make' to run the makefile which will compile the program

3) Once compiled type 'Clean' to remove excess files.

4) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location
