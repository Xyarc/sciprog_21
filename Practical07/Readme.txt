This Practical contains two programs:

1. Mem_allocation.c - This program dynamically allocated an array fills the array with ones prints the array then frees the array from memory.

2. Polynomial.c - This program estimates 'e' using a series then compares the estimation to the real value of 'e'


To compile and run the programs do the following:

1) Compile both Mem_allocation.c & polynomial.c with 'gcc -o <Executable name> <Filename> -lm' in the file location

2) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location.
