This Practical contains two programs:

1. Fibonacci.c - This program takes user input to calculate the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.

2. HypoTangent.c - This program calculates ArcTan using the Maclaron Series and Natural Log then compares the two calculation methods.

To compile and run the programs do the following:

1) Compile both HypoTangent.c & Fibonacci.c with 'gcc -o <Executable name> <Filename> -lm' in the file location

2) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location.
