This Practical contains two programs:
1. Sum.c - This program shows that when you sum up and sum down even though mathematically they are identical that because of the assignment of floats to mememory the result can differ.
2. Conversion.c - This program shows when you have a binary number and print it as an int or a float the value can be different because of the assignment of the number in memory. 


To compile and run the programs do the following:

1) Compile both Sum.c & Conversion.c with 'gcc -o <Executable name> <Filename> -lm' in the file location

2) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location.
