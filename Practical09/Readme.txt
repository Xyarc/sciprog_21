This practical contians a program to check if an inputed square of numbers is a magic square by reading the input from a file.

The time complexity of the isMagicSquare funciton is O(n^2) as the function cycles trough two for loops to chech the sides of squares which have O(n) so T(n) = n*n operations.

To compile and run the programs do the following:

1) Compile both MagicSquare.c with 'gcc -o <Executable name> <Filename> -lm' in the file location

2) To run program use './<Executable name>' in the file location.
